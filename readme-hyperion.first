Please note that not EVERYTHING on this CD is under the GPL.
The Quake 2 and qtools and the DLL System and the Mods D-Day, Star Wars, Q2Max
and Threewave CTF *are* under GPL. 

Please note that if you are interested in a different licence for the DLL-System 
than the GPL (for example to compile Mods which are not under GPL like ActionQuake) 
you should discuss this issue with me (SteffenH@hyperion-entertainment.com) or Ben Hermans.
Such a licence could include something like "may be used for AmigaOS-based Projects free
of charge". For details contact me or Ben Hermans. For GPL-based-projects you can of course just use the GPL-version of
the DLL Library without any limitations other than the GPL, and you do not need
to ask for permission or anything like it, other than making sure that you do not
harm the regulations of the GPL.

Please note the stuff inside lib.hpa is only needed for StormC, not for
other compilers.

If you'd like to release a recompile for not-GPLed Quake 2 Mods
- for Example like ActionQuake or Fireteam - you need to have a different 
licence'd version for the DLL-System than the GPL-version included on this CD. 
(As Mods like ActionQuake are not under the GPL, but under a different OpenSource
licence).

Most Q2 Mods are not under GPL, so you cannot 
release Binaries linked with the GPL-version of the DLL-Code. If you find Source-Code
for an Amiga-Port of a Not-GPLed Quake 2 Mod on this CD or on other places which does
include a file dll.h, then please assume this file was given under a different
licence than the GPL ("can be used free of charge for AmigaOS-based projects" basically, contact me for details).
Please note that if you need a different licenced version of the DLL-Code that
we are quite open to sensible suggestions about it, so don't be afraid to ask!!!

Please also note that depending on which compilers you use you might
have to do small adaptions in the makefiles (calling elf2exe2 or not
for example). For some Mods there are also StormC 68k project files
included to compile a 68k (Beta) version of Quake 2. Never tried if
they still work with the most recent version. But they should, normally.
The StormC 68k version needed some optimizer-stuff disabled to work without
graphics bugs and that did "break" it on Amithlon (and made it extremely
slow on a real Amiga). A gcc 68k 2.95.3 version compiled had even more graphics bugs.
I think the issue is something with the linker libraries.
